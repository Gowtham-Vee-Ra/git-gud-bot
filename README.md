> "I am sworn to carry your code review burdens" - Git Gud Bot, probably

## 🎯 What's This All About?

Ever wished your code reviews were less "meh" and more "yeah!"? Git Gud Bot is your friendly neighborhood code review companion that helps developers level up their game! It's like having a senior developer who never sleeps, never gets hangry, and actually enjoys reviewing your nested if statements.

### 🌟 Features That Make You Go "Woah!"

- **Automated Code Analysis**: We'll spot those sneaky bugs faster than you can say "production hotfix"
- **Best Practice Enforcement**: Because "it works on my machine" isn't a coding standard
- **Performance Insights**: We'll tell you if your code runs slower than a turtle in a tar pit
- **Style Checking**: Making your code prettier than your Instagram filters
- **Smart Suggestions**: Like a GPS for your code, but without the "recalculating" part
